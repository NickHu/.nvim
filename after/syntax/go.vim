" the regions that contain=@CSource all use the goComment region as well,
" because the Vim C comment syntax rule is defined with "extend", which breaks
" badly when you have:
" /*
" // c source lines here
" /*
" // more c source
" */
" import "C"
"
" When you defer to Vim's C syntax rules, everything
" after the */ is treated like C source, because the */ is matched
" by the C comment rule even though the cgo region as a whole matched.
" The "extend" keyword causes the cgo region to continue.
" The goComment region does not use extend, and so the cgo region ends when
" it should.
"
" TODO(chrisnc): currently, in line-commented import "C" blocks, C
" preprocessor directives (#include, #define) etc., are not highlighted.
" This is because the C syntax defines them with a ^ match rule, which will
" not match inside of a line comment as the line starts with // even though
" these characters are not in the region due to rs=s+2.
" To fix this one could use modified versions of the C preprocessor matching
" rules and include them in the cgoSourceLine region's contains attribute.
" Other solutions may be possible...
" C preprocessor directives are highlighted correctly within
" /* */
